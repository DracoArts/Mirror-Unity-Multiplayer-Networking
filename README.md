#  Mirror Unity Multiplayer Networking Example 
Mirror is a high-performance, easy-to-use networking solution built specifically for Unity, designed to streamline and simplify the development of multiplayer games. As a community-driven fork of Unityâ€™s now-deprecated UNET (Unity Networking) system, Mirror retains the familiar API structure that made UNET accessible while addressing its limitationsâ€”delivering better performance, enhanced stability, and modern features that meet todayâ€™s multiplayer game development needs. Unlike UNET, which was officially discontinued by Unity, Mirror is actively maintained and improved by a dedicated community of developers, ensuring ongoing support, bug fixes, and optimizations.

# ðŸ”¹ What is Mirror Networking?
## Mirror is a Unity networking library that provides:

- Simple API for beginners

- Powerful features for advanced developers

- Server-authoritative architecture (prevents cheating)

- Flexible transport layers (TCP, UDP, WebSockets)

-  Automatic object synchronization (SyncVars, Commands, RPCs)

## Why Use Mirror Instead of UNET or Netcode?

- âœ… Open-source & free (MIT License)

- âœ… Better performance than UNET

- âœ… Active community & updates

- âœ… Works with modern Unity versions

 - âœ… Supports dedicated servers, P2P, and relay servers

 # ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts in Mirror

## 1. NetworkManager

- The central controller for multiplayer games.

### Handles:
- ### Player spawning

- ### Scene management

- ### Connection callbacks (when players join/leave)
## 2. NetworkIdentity

- Marks a GameObject as a networked object.

- Required for any object that needs to be synchronized across clients.

## 3. NetworkBehaviour

- A base class for networked scripts (like MonoBehaviour but for multiplayer).

- Contains networking features:

 ## [SyncVar] 
  - Synchronized variables

## [Command]

- Client â†’ Server function calls

## [ClientRpc] 
-  Server â†’ Client function calls

## [TargetRpc] 
- Server â†’ Specific client function calls


## 4. SyncVars
- Automatically syncs variables from server â†’ clients.

- Example: Player health, score, position.

- Supports hooks (functions that trigger when the value changes).

## 5. Commands ([Command])
- Client â†’ Server function calls.

- Used for player input (e.g., movement, shooting).

- Only the local player can call commands on their own objects.

## 6. Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)
 ####  Server â†’ Clients ([ClientRpc])

- Broadcasts to all clients (e.g., spawning effects).

#### Server â†’ Specific Client ([TargetRpc])

- Sends to one client (e.g., private messages).

## 7. NetworkTransform
- Automatically syncs position, rotation, and scale.

- Can be customized for smoother movement (interpolation).

## ðŸ”¹ How Mirror Networking Works
 ### 1. Server-Client Architecture
- Server (Host) â€“ The authority that controls game logic.

- Clients â€“ Players connected to the server.

-  Host Mode â€“ A player acts as both server & client (like in P2P games).

### 2. Player Movement Example
- Client sends input via [Command].

- Server validates and applies movement.

- Server updates [SyncVar] position.

- Clients receive updates and render smoothly.

## 3. Anti-Cheat & Lag Compensation
- Server-authoritative movement prevents speed hacks.

- Client-side prediction makes controls feel responsive.

- Lag compensation adjusts hit detection for delayed players.


# ðŸ”¹ Mirror Networking Setup (Step-by-Step)
### 1. Installation

- Option 1: Unity Package Manager â†’ Add from Git URL:

https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror.git

- Option 2: Download from Asset Store
  [Mirror](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321?srsltid=AfmBOooLuaHckeUba47IC9HGyue7dupkXuMtO40ZCY2CE5n-0qLB5C95)

### 2. Basic Setup

  #### 1 .Add NetworkManager to an empty GameObject.

 #### 2 .Create a Player Prefab and add:

- NetworkIdentity

- NetworkTransform (if movement needs syncing)

- A script with NetworkBehaviour

#### 3. Assign the Player Prefab in the NetworkManager.
# âœ… Advantages

âœ” Easy to learn (similar to UNET)

âœ” High performance (optimized for games)\

âœ” Works with modern Unity (2020 LTS+)

âœ” Supports WebGL & dedicated servers

âœ” Active Discord community


## Usage/Examples
## 1. Setup NetworkManager
    using Mirror;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class MyNetworkManager : NetworkManager
    {
    public override void OnServerAddPlayer(NetworkConnection conn)
    {
        base.OnServerAddPlayer(conn);
        
        GameObject player = conn.identity.gameObject;
        
        player.GetComponent<PlayerController>().SetRandomColor();
       }
    }

## 2. Player Controller

    using Mirror;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class PlayerController : NetworkBehaviour
    {
    [SyncVar]
    private Color playerColor;

    private Material playerMaterial;
    
    void Start()
    {
        playerMaterial = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
        
        if (isLocalPlayer)
        {
            // Only local player can move
            GetComponent<PlayerMovement>().enabled = true;
        }
        
        UpdateColor();
    }
    
    public void SetRandomColor()
    {
        if (isServer)
        {
            playerColor = new Color(
                Random.Range(0f, 1f),
                Random.Range(0f, 1f),
                Random.Range(0f, 1f)
            );
        }
    }
    
    private void UpdateColor()
    {
        playerMaterial.color = playerColor;
    }
    

    void OnPlayerColorChanged(Color oldColor, Color newColor)
    {
        UpdateColor();
     }
    }

## 3. Player Movement



    using Mirror;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class PlayerMovement : NetworkBehaviour
    {
    public float speed = 5f;
    
    void Update()
    {
        if (!isLocalPlayer) return;
        
        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        
        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0f, moveVertical);
        transform.Translate(movement * speed * Time.deltaTime);
        
       
    }
    
  
    }

## Setup Scene:

 - Create a new empty GameObject and add the MyNetworkManager component

- Add a NetworkManagerHUD component for testing UI

- Create a player prefab with:

- NetworkIdentity component

- PlayerController component

- PlayerMovement component

- Renderer and Collider components

- Assign the player prefab in the NetworkManager
